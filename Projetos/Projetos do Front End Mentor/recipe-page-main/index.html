      An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked 
      to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.
    
      Preparation time
    
      Total: Approximately 10 minutes
      Preparation: 5 minutes
      Cooking: 5 minutes
    
      Ingredients
    
      2-3 large eggs
      Salt, to taste
      Pepper, to taste
      1 tablespoon of butter or oil
      Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
    
      Instructions
    
      Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
      You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
    
      Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
    
      Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
      the eggs evenly coat the surface.
    
      Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
      middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
    
      Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
      fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
    
      Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
